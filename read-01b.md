## How to maintain a growth mindset

* Remember that *failure* is an **opportunity to learn**.

* You are a **learner**. You may not understand a new concept....**yet**. With perseverance you will understand.
* Be self-reflective. Notice when you feel frustration or begin to lose focus. Ask yourself what contributes to those feelings.
* Be comfortable with the uncomfortable.
