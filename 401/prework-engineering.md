# Engineering Readings

Prompts:

*What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?*

I think something I bring is a variety of work experiences outside of the tech industry and strong customer focus. I've worked in various environments and believe I have resilience in challenging situations. Some of this I would attribute to my experiences in customer service and social services.

*What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?*

1. Review the problem thoroughly to ensure I understand the problem and what is being asked.
2. Break down problems into sub-problems, ones I can solve piece by piece.
3. Focus on the potential successes and not on previous failures.
