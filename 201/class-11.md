## Images (Duckett HTML p 406-427)

use `<width>` and `<height>` to control image size. images are inline elements by default.

use the `float` property to align images. Turn an image into a block level element to center the image. Use `text-align` on the containing element or set the marigin's left and right properties to `auto`.

`background-image` is used to place an image behind an HTML element. it will repeat by default.

`background-repeat` can have the following values: 

* `repeat` - repeated both horizontally and vertically
* `repeat-x` - repeated horizontally
* `repeat-y` - repeated vertically
* `no-repeat` - image shown once

`background-attachment` specifies whether the image should stay `fixed` or move with the user via `scroll`

`background-position` specifies where a non-repeated image will live. usually has two values. (ex. `right-bottom` or `center top` etc)
