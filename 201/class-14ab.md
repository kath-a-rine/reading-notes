# Psychological Safety and CSS

Psychological safety refers to the team group culture in which members feel safe to bring their full selves to their work. They feel safe to exchange ideas and thoughts without fear of embarassment or shame.

Through research into what makes effective teams, Google found that similarity between members matters less. What matters most is the ability for members to share space equitably and their ability to read others emotions.

## CSS

the `transform` property allows elements to be tranformed either in 2d or 3d.

2d transformations work on a 2d plane, on the x and y axes.

3d transformations work on x, y, and z axes. 3d defines the depth of an element as well as length and width.

transition related properties change an element when a state change occurs.

## I want to know more about 

CSS in general. It is absolutely an area I need more practice in. I don't yet feel comfortable enough in CSS to play with these newer to me properties. I'll just have to get into the "sandbox" and play around more.
