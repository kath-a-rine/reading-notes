# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

## Links

* Link to other sites `<a href="Absolute URL Link">link title</a>`
* Link to pages within same site `<a href="relative URL link">Page Title</a>`
* `<a href="mailto:email address">email name</a>`
* `target="_blank"` opens new window. used when user is linked to external site
* Linking to part of the same page - id the elements to be linked to. use `<a href ="#idname>`
* Linking to part of another page - use id url followed by `/#idname`

## CSS Layout

* Normal flow - block-level element sits on top of next.
* relative positioning - moves element in relation to normal flow position
* aboslute positioning - positioned in relation to containing element. does not affect position of other elements. move as user scrolls up and down page.
* fixed positioning - positions element in relation to browser window.
* floating elements - positioned to left or right in containing box. becomes block-level element.
* z-index - "stacking context". equivalent of "bring to front/send to back"

## JS Functions

* functions - allow you to group statements to perform a task. Execute by calling the function. Functions can be called before they are declared.
* functions that need specific information are given parameters. Used like variables within the function.
* named functions are called using their name
* function expressions - where the function is found where you would see an expression. cannot be called before it is declared.
* local variables - variable created inside a function
* global variable - variable created outside of a function. uses more memory, as the browser must remember it while the page is in use.

## Benefits of paired programming

* paired programming gives programmers practice in listening, speaking, reading and writing. It allows for exposure to new ideas and gives an opportunity to learn from eachother.

# Things I want to know more about

* when you would want to use a function expression over a function declaration.
