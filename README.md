#### What is growth mindset?

Growth mindset is the belief that learning and knowledge is something that can be developed over time. Learning is not a fixed state, but one that can "grow" there perseverence and practice. Anyone is capable of learning something new. 

#### How to maintain a growth mindset:
* Remember that *failure* is an **opportunity to learn**. 
* You are a **learner**. You may not understand a new concept....**yet**. With perseverance you will understand.
* Be self-reflective. Notice when you feel frustration or begin to lose focus. Ask yourself what contributes to those feelings. 
* Be comfortable with the uncomfortable.
