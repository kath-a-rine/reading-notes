1. **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?** Personal home computers were had become accessible to many US households and were marketed solely towards males.
2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?** - It meant that they had earlier formative experience with computers. They essentially had more experience programming before ever taking a computer science course. This in a way further enforced the idea that "males are better with computers" when in reality the issue was having access to a computer itself, not a true gendered stereotype.

1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?** - When the commitment to diversity is from the top down. Leadership must support these efforts and invest in them if they are genuinely interested in diversifying their workforce.  
2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?** - Diverse teams have a range of experiences and perspectives they bring to work, resulting in a smarter and more creative team.
3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.** - Homogenous workforces will only build and create what they know. Companies that are largely male and white will only ever know how to build something catered to their own perspectives and interests. Diversity in the workforce, and meaningful diversity at that (i.e. in leadership roles and roles beyond those "traditionally" considered to be appropriate for specific groups), means companies can build better products that resonate with diverse audiences.
