## [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack]()

1. **What is a ‘call’?** - function invocation
2. **How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?** - one
3. **What does LIFO mean?** - Last in, first out
4. **Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

5. **What causes a Stack Overflow?** - a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point

## [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

1. **What is a ‘reference error’?** - a variable is undefined
2. **What is a ‘syntax error’?** - when syntax is incorrect and cannot be parsed
3. **What is a ‘range error’?** - when an array length is invalid
4. **What is a ‘type error’?** - when the type of data used is incompatible
5. **What is a breakpoint?** - a "break" in the code where the code will stop running
6. **What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?** - allows you to see the "history" of the code prior to reaching the breakpoint

## Things I want to know more about

- debugging in general. i've learned through getting TA help that I need to practice debgging before calling a TA when I am stuck
- understanding the call stack and how functions are invoked to generate that call stack
