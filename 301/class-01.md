# Introduction to React and Components

## [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

1. What is a component?
A component is “a software object intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or functionalities.”
2. What are the characteristics of a component?

* Reusability
* Replaceable
* Not context specific - components can operate in different environments and contexts
* Extensible
* Encapsulated - components do not expose internal processes, variables, or state
* Independent - components have minimal dependency on other components

3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

* Ease of development and deployment
* Reduced cost using third-party components
* Reusability
* Independence
* Modification of technical complexity
* Reliability
* System maintenance and evolution - easy to change and update single components without impacting the whole system

## [What is Props and How to Use it in React](https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProps%E2%80%9D%20is%20a%20special%20keyword,way%20from%20parent%20to%20child)

1. What is “props” short for? - Properties
2. How are props used in React? - For passing data from one component to the next
