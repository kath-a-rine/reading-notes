1. 
| SQL  | NoSQL|
|----------|-------|
|Relational| Non-relational or distributed|
|Uses structure query language to define and manipulate data| Queries focused on a collection of documents|
| table-based | document based |
| ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance|

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? - complex query intensive environment
3. Give a real world example. MySQL database
4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? - hierarchical data storage, storing data as key-value pairs. Preferred for large data sets.
5. Give a real world example. - MongoDB
6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? - NoSQL

6. How does it work?
7. What is inside of a Mongo database? - *one or more collections of documents* - from [MongoDB - Databases and Collections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/#:~:text=MongoDB%20stores%20data%20records%20as,or%20more%20collections%20of%20documents.)
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. - MongoDB scales easily with large amounts of data - from [MongoDB - NoSQL Explained](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database? - It is harder to change the data due to its format.
