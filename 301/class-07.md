# REST

[How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

* Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

* Because our current techniques were not designed for that purpose.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

Applies verbs to nouns - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.

4. What does a GET do?

* retrieves data from a server

5. What does a POST do?

* sends data to the server

6. What does PUT do?

* replaces something in another system. “Replaces all current representations of the target resource" - from [mdn - HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)

7. What does PATCH do?

* does partial updates to a resource

***Additional Resources Used***

* [mdn - HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
