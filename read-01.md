# Learning Markdown 

Markdown is a markup language for generating html files. It uses textual symbols to help you format a plain text page. Unlike html, Markdown is meant to be easier to read and write.

### Markdown Basic Syntax

Markdown uses textual symbols to indicate the sturcture of a page and to format text. With basic syntax you can *italicize* words. You can use **bolded text** and you can ***emphasize text with both bold and italics.*** Beyond formatting text, you can also create footnotes[^1], use emojis üññ, 

* create
* lists

and more! 

A quick [Google](https://google.com/) search will lead you to many articles, cheatsheets, and guides on how to use Markdown Basic Syntax.
