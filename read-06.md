# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that allows you to create interactive and dynamic websites.

**HTML** - what you read

**CSS** - what you see

**JavaScript** - what you do

JavaScript responds to user input. Examples of JS in action could inclue: a popup box, a form where you would input your name or other information, messages tailored to you based on your inputs.

**Variables** - containers for storing data
 
 Variables are deinded by unique names or ***identifiers***. Identifiers are case sensitive.

## **Declaring a JS variable**

You declare a variable with:

* `const` - for constant, the value of the variable does not change
* `let` - the value of the variable will change
* `var` (used prior to 2015)
* using nothing, leaving the variable undeclared

Values are **assigned** to variables using `=`

In JavaScript `===` is used to signify something equals another.
