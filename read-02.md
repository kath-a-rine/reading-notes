### Choosing a Text Editor

**What is a text editor?** A text editor is software, either downloaded and installed on your computer or online in a browser, that allows you to write text. Examples of text editors include: Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and Google Docs. Text editors (or code editors) are needed to wirte the code that ultimately becomes a web page. 

**Examples of code editors:** NotePad++, GitHub's Atom, and Microsoft's VS Code. 

Text editors allow you to write code more easily. Some will include something called ***code completion***. In HTML you use opening and closing brackets or quotations around elements. Missing a quotation, bracket, or semicolon can lead to errors. Code completion can help you write more *complete* code that is (hopefully) free of errors. 

***Syntax highlighting*** is another useful feature in many text editors. Syntax highlighting will use different colors for different elements, attributes, and copy in your code. This makes it much easier to differentiate items in your code.

***The "best" text editor will be the one you like to use with features that are helpful to you.*** 

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Text Editors

While a text editor edits text, an IDE is much more rolled into one.
