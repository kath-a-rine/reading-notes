# Operators and Loops

## **Operators**

An operator performs an operation and produces a result.

`++` is an increment operator. it adds one to its operand and returns a value. 

### **Comparison Operators**

A comparison operator commpares its operands and returns a value based on if the comparison is true. Numerical, string, logical or object values can all be operands.

If two operands are not the same type, JavaScript tries to convert them to an appropriate type for comparison.

***The following are exceptions to this conversion:***

`===` - strict equality

`!==` - strict inequality

### **Assignment Operators**

Assigment operators *assign* a value to its left operand based on the value of the right operand. Equal `=` is a simple operator.

See [MDN - Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) for a list of assignment and comparison operators.

## **Loops**

Loops are a way of doing something repeatedly. They repeat an action some number of times.

Statements for loops in JavaScript:

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for... in statement
* for... of statement

### `for statement`

A `for` loop will repeat until a condition is evaluated as `false`.

### `while statement`

A `while` statement executes as long as a condition evaluates as `true`. Once a condition is `false` the statement will stop executing.

Use `{...}` (a block statement) to execute multiple statements.
