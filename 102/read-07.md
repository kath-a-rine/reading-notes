# Programming with JavaScript

Computers cannot make assumptions. Computers need explicit directions to do what you want them to.

## Control Flow

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code runs from the first line in a file to the last line, *unless* the computer runs across conditions and loops, structures that change the control flow.

`if...else` is an example of a conditional structure.

**loop** - a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met.

**functions** - a peice of code that can be called by other code or by itself, or a variable refers to the function.

**object** - collections of properties. Properties are identified using key values. A string value of a symbol value is a key value. 

**events** - assets generated by DOM elements

    DOM (Doctument Object Model) is an API (Application Programming INterface) that interacts with any HTML or XML document.

>Control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code. - [MDN Web Docs - Control Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

## JavaScript Functions

A function is executed when something calls it.

Function Syntax: the `function` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses `()`.

The code to be executed by the function is inside curly brackets `{}`.

**parameters** are listed inside the parentheses `()`.

A function is invoked (called) when:

* an event occurs
* when invoked from JavaScript code
* automatically (self invoked)

## Why functions?

You can reuse code!

Functions can be used like variables in formulas, assignments and calculations.
