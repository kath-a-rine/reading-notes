# Wireframe and HTML

## What is a wireframe?

Essential tool in planning a website, app, or product.

* Define and plan the information hierarchy of design for website, app, or product. 
* Focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information.
* Plan the layout and interaction of your interface.

Wireframes on paper or whiteboard are easy to change

Depending on the complexity of the project, going from wireframe to coding can look different.

**Examples:**

- Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design

- Sketch > Code

- Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code

- Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

**Steps to make a wireframe:**

1. Do your research - understand your audience. Check out similar existing products.
2. Prepare your research for quick reference - create a cheatsheet of your research to keep on track with project goals
3. Make sure user flow is mapped out - how do you want a user to interact with your project? Where will the user be coming from and where do you want them to go?
4. “Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate”
5. Add detail and test
6. Turn wireframe into prototype

***Three Key principles***

* Clarity
* Confidence
* Simplicity is key

## HTML Basics

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. Consists of a series of elements, that are enclosed to make content appear a certain way.

### **Anatomy of an HTML Element**

Elements can also have attributes. Attributes are extra information about the element you don’t want to appear in the page.

### Nesting Elements

Elements inside other elements are said to be nesting. Elements must be properly nested in order to work. i.e. DON'T FORGET YOUR CLOSING TAGS.

### **Semantics**

Semantics refers to the meaning of a peice of code. 

Refer to [this article on semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) to learn more and see a list of some semantic elements. There about 100 semantic elements.
